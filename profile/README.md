# CS3028 Group Foxtrot

## Organisation Overview
This organisation was created to manage the *CS3028 Principles of Software Engineering*/*CS3528 Software Engineering and Professional Practice* project. In it, our group - Group Foxtrot - will work with the National Decommissioning Centre to develop the Simulation Scene Editor for the Marine Simulator. This project is intended to strengthen not only our technical skills but also our soft skills.

### The Team
- **Project Manager/SCRUM Master** -> John Dunbar
- **Product Owner** -> Kieran Thursby
- **Developers** -> Abdurrehman Sajid, Archie Mearns, Dylan Cairney, Graham Murray, John Dunbar, Kieran Thursby, Mateusz Templin, Shaelen Fernandes
- **Testers** -> John Dunbar
- **Documenters** -> Archie Mearns, Mateusz Templin

These roles were established and assigned based on each individual's self-identified strengths.

### Project Overview

Working Name: *Simulacra*

The team will be taking the existing simulator scene editor developed by the NDC and improving upon it (further details to be added following the client meeting on 03/10/2024).

### Meeting Schedule
- *In-Person*: 09:00 - 11:00 BST Thursdays
- *Online*: TBC

### Team Member Expectations
To ensure the project runs as efficiently as possible, all team members are expected to adhere to the following list of expectations:
1. Attend *at least* the weekly in-person meeting on Thursdays to provide progress reports and discuss any upcoming feature releases.
2. Make every effort to adhere to development deadlines and provide sufficient notice if a deadline will be missed with reasoning.
3. Assist other team members if required, and conversely, ask for assistance if required.
4. Actively contribute to the project in a meaningful manner.

### Escalation Protocol
In the event a team member is not meeting the aforementioned expectations, the following escalation scale will be actioned:
1. Either the Project Manager or Product Owner will get in touch to see if there is any way they can help, and provide development extensions where required. If they receive no response, the escalation moves to **Level 2**.
2. One of the course coordinators will be informed and will subsequently get in touch to make sure there are no personal issues causing expectations not to be met, and will provide assistance/extensions where required. If they receive no response, the escalation moves to **Level 3**.
3. A final notice is given to the team member stating that failure to reply within 48 hours will result in being removed from the group, and re-admittance will require approval from the course coordinator and a fixed contribution score of 10%.
